Third Party Software
====================

This code uses the following third party software/source code.

## Premake

- Where: https://premake.github.io/download
- What: Build configuration and generator
- License: BSD 3-Clause

Premake generates platform/toolchain specific build files, such as Visual
Studio project files or standard Makefiles. This project includes prebuilt
binaries for Linux and Windows.

## Volk

- Where: https://github.com/zeux/volk
- What: "Meta-loader for Vulkan"
- License: MIT License

Volk allows applications to dynamically load the Vulkan API without linking
against vulkan-1.dll or libvulkan.so. Furthermore, it enables the loading of
device-specific Vulkan functions, the use of which skips the overhead of
dispatching per-device.

Note: Only the source code (volk.{h,c}) and the license and readme files are
included here. The volk.c source is modified to include the volk.h header
correctly for this project.

## Vulkan Headers

- Where: Vulkan SDK (see https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)
- What: Vulkan API header files
- License: Apache 2.0

This is a copy of the necessary Vulkan header files, extracted from the Vulkan
SDK (version 1.3.289). Only the LICENSE.txt, README.txt and a reduced amount of
header files are included.

## Reflect

- Where: https://github.com/qlibs/reflect
- What: Reflection for C++20
- License: MIT

## STB libraries

- Where: https://github.com/nothings/stb
- What: single-header libraries
- License: Public Domain / MIT License

Collection of single-header libraries by Sean Barrett. Included are:
- stb_image.h         (image loading)
- stb_image_write.h   (image writing)

Note: the files in src/ are custom.

## Shaderc / glslc

- Where: https://github.com/google/shaderc
- What: GLSL to SpirV compiler
- License: Apache v2.0

Note: only pre-built glslc[.exe] compiler binaries for 64-bit Windows,
64-bit Linux and 64-bit MacOS are included here.

The glslc compiler is an offline compiler toolt that accepts (among others)
GLSL sources and compiles these to SpirV code that can be passed to Vulkan.

## GLFW

- Where: https://www.glfw.org/
- What: Multi-platform lib for OpenGL & Vulkan development (desktop)
- License: Zlib/libpng

GLFW abstracts platform-specific functions, such as creating windows and
receiving/handling events. 

## VulkanMemoryAllocator

- Where: https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator
- What: Vulkan memory allocation library
- License: MIT License

An easy to integrate Vulkan memory allocation library developed by AMD. See
section "Problem" in their README.md for a concise description of the problems
it solves.

Note: the file in src/ is custom.

For compatibility with Volk, we need to define
  - VMA_STATIC_VULKAN_FUNCTIONS = 0
  - VMA_DYNAMIC_VULKAN_FUNCTIONS = 1
This way, we can pass just two function pointers to VMA when we're initializing
it, and it will load the rest itself. The definitions are only needed when
compiling the VMA implementation code, and are therefore only defined in the
custom vk_mem_alloc.cpp.

## GLM

- Where: https://github.com/g-truc/glm
- What: C++ math library for OpenGL / GLSL
- License: The Happy Bunny License OR MIT License

GLM defines various math / linear algebra functions. Notes:

Defines the following by default:
- GLM_FORCE_RADIANS: make sure angles are in radians
- GLM_FORCE_SIZE_T_LENGTH: return lengths as std::size_t, like the C++ 
  standard containers.
- GLM_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL: enable "experimental" features such as those
  in the gtx/transforms.hpp header.

GLM_FORCE_DEPTH_ZERO_TO_ONE is not defined. GLM normally targets OpenGL with a
depth range of [-1, 1], whereas Vulkan uses [0, 1]. We deal with this by 
explicitly calling the specificic functions for this.

GLM is a header only library, so we don't have to compile anything for it.
(Hence using project type "Utility" in premake.)

## rapidobj

- Where: https://github.com/guybrush77/rapidobj
- What: single-header .OBJ file loader
- License: MIT

C++17 single header library for loading Wavefront OBJ files. Reasonably fast.
Uses multithreading to load larger OBJ files.

Note: only includes the actual header, README and LICENSE files.

## tgen

- Where: https://github.com/mlimper/tgen
- What: single-source generator for tangents/bitangents
- License: Public Domain

Simple library to compute compute an orthonormal tangent space from an indexed
mesh with positions and texture coordinates. The orthonormal tangent space
transform is represented by a normal, a tangent and a "flip factor" (indicates
mirroring).

## zstd

- Where: https://github.com/facebook/zstd
- What: Zstandard - Fast real-time compression algorithm 
- License: BSD

Zstandard ("zstd") compression library. Originally developed by Facebook/Meta,
it targets fast (lossless) compression with high compression ratios. This only
includes the decompressor module.
